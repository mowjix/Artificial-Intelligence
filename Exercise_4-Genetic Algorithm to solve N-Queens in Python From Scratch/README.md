Using [Genetic Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm) to solve the [N-Queens problem](https://www.javatpoint.com/n-queens-problems#:~:text=N%20-%20Queens%20problem%20is%20to%20place%20n,4%20queens%20problem%20and%20then%20generate%20it%20).

## In summary 
The aim of N-Queens Problem is to place N queens on an N x N chessboard, in a way so that no queen is in conflict with the others.

## Terminology
- Gene:  An individual is characterized by a set of variables
- Chromosome: Genes are joined into a string to form a Chromosome (solution). A chromosome is a set of parameters which define a proposed solution to the problem that the genetic algorithm is trying to solve
- Population: The set of all solutions
- Fitness Function: Pairs of non-attacking queens (say for N=6, Fmax= 6C2 = 6*5/2 = 15)
- Crossover: Also called recombination, is a genetic operator used to combine the genetic information of two parents to generate new offspring
- Mutation: It alters one or more gene values in a chromosome from its initial state

### How the genetic algorithm solves the n-queen problem?
- Step 1: A random chromosome is generated
- Step 2: Fitness value of the chromosome is calculated
- Step 3: If fitness is not equal to Fmax
- Step 4: Reproduce (crossover) new chromosome from 2 randomly selected best chromosomes
- Step 5: Mutation may take place
- Step 6: New chromosome added to population
- Repeat Step 2 to 6 until a chromosome (solution) with Fitness value = Fmax is found

### Note
Since most of the process is random, it doesn't always take the same time to converge to a solution. If you want to dig deep, watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt85_CinKwo&t=4s).
